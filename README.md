Patrick... Try asking questions to chatGPT https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/ for code related things (I am not always on my computer to help). Start with a question like.. How do I set up flask on my windows laptop?

It will give you really good resutls and it will do it very quickly. Its a relatively new tool that I have been giving out to new members on my development team as a quick resource.

Once you have the flask website set up, you can work on your python by asking questions like... How do I get the weather for my area with python?
It will give you a description on how you should do it. it will even give the basic code sample that you need to make it work.
