Initial Environment settings

1) use a venv from a directory. (use the below command to create the directory, enter it, and create the virtual environment)

  mkdir /var/www/info_flask
  cd /var/www/info_flask
  mkdir templates
  mkdir static
  python3 -m venv venv
  
  
  
  Copy all folders within this repo directly into the directory in the matching places


2) install the required packages. NOTE: the terminal on the pi should be something like username@ip (venv):
    do all the below commands to download and initialize the flask packages

    pip install flask
    
    
    
you can install additional packages later using pip install <package>
